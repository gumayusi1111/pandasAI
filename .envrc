# .envrc for direnv
# This file tells direnv to use the Poetry layout, which automatically
# activates the virtual environment associated with this project.
#
# Make sure direnv is correctly installed and hooked into your shell
# (e.g., by adding 'eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"' to your .zshrc).
#
# If you encounter 'layout_poetry: command not found', it means your
# direnv installation or shell hook is not working correctly, as
# 'layout_poetry' is a standard direnv function.
